Write a program that:
- Takes a list containing integers, floats, and strings.
- Loops through the list and:
  - If the element is an integer, prints its square.
  - If the element is a float, prints its square root.
  - If the element is a string, prints the string in uppercase.

## 2. Functions, Loops, and Lists
Write a function that:
- Takes a list of integers as an argument.
- Loops through the list and returns two separate lists:
  - One with even numbers.
  - One with odd numbers.

## 3. Strings, Loops, and Functions
Write a program that:
- Takes a string input from the user.
- Loops through the string to count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are present.
- The program should return the count of vowels and the percentage of vowels in the string.

## 4. Loops, Lists, Functions, and Conditionals
Write a function that:
- Takes a list of integers as input.
- Loops through the list and returns a new list with numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

## 5. Loops, Conditionals, and Data Types
Write a program that:
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- If positive, prints the number squared.
- If negative, prints the number cubed.
- If zero, prints "Zero entered".

## 6. Loops, Functions, and Sequences
Write a function that:
- Takes an integer `n`.
- Returns a list of the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci series using a loop.

## 7. Strings, Loops, and Functions
Write a program that:
- Takes a list of strings as input.
- Loops through the list and checks if each string contains only alphabets (no numbers or special characters).
- Returns a list of strings that contain only alphabets.

## 8. Lists, Loops, Conditionals, and Functions
Write a program that:
- Takes a list of integers as input.
- Loops through the list, and for each integer, checks if it is divisible by 2 or 3.
- Returns the count of numbers divisible by 2, the count of numbers divisible by 3, and the numbers divisible by both 2 and 3.

## 9. Functions, Lists, and String Manipulation
Write a function that:
- Takes a sentence (string) as input.
- Loops through the sentence and counts how many words in the sentence start with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
- Returns the count of words starting with a vowel.

## 10. Data Types, Lists, Loops, and Functions
Write a program that:
- Takes a list containing mixed data types (integers, strings, floats).
- Loops through the list and:
  - Adds integers and floats to one list.
  - Adds strings to another list.
- Prints both lists at the end.
