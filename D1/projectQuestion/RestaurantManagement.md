# RestaurantManagement System - Python Console Program

### **Problem Statement**

Design and implement a Python console-based **Restaurant Management System** that manages various customer interactions and processes. The system should include the following features:

### **Features:**

1. **Customer Age-Based Discount:**
   - If the customer is **60 years old or above**, they should receive a **10% discount** on the total bill.
  
2. **Seat Booking:**
   - The system should allow customers to book **seats**. For example, a customer should be able to book 3 seats or 2 seats.

3. **Children's Entry Policy:**
   - If the customer has **children** and is booking seats, the system should check if the children are accompanied by a **parent**. If they are not accompanied by a parent, children should not be allowed.
  
4. **Food Menu:**
   - The system should provide a list of **food items** and their prices. The food menu items should include things like Pizza, Burger, Pasta, Salad, and Soup.
  
5. **Free Day for Frequent Customers:**
   - If a customer visits the restaurant for **10 or more days**, they should be eligible for a **free meal on the 11th day**. This can be calculated based on the number of days the customer has visited the restaurant.

### **Your Task:**
Implement a Python program that satisfies the above features. The program should:
- Accept customer details (name, age, number of days they've visited, children status).
- Allow booking of seats.
- Display the food menu.
- Calculate the discount if applicable.
- Check if the customer qualifies for a free meal.

### **Example Scenario:**
1. A customer named "John" who is 65 years old comes to the restaurant. He books 2 seats and chooses a Pizza and a Soup from the menu.
   - Since John is above 60, he should receive a **10% discount**.
   
2. A customer named "Alice" has 2 children. They are accompanied by their parents, so they are allowed to enter. Alice orders a Pasta and a Salad.
   
3. A customer named "Bob" has visited the restaurant 10 times and is eligible for a **free meal on the 11th visit**.
